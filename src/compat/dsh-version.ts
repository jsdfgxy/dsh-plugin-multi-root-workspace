/**
 * The DSH compatibility contract: which upstream releases this plugin is
 * actually verified against, and how an installation is judged against that
 * list.
 *
 * This module is the ONE place the support matrix is spelled out. It is
 * deliberately pure — no cordis, no logging, no process exit — so that the
 * runtime gate (`src/compat.ts`), the static gate (`scripts/check-dsh-compat.mjs`)
 * and the tests all judge an installation by the same code instead of three
 * drifting copies of the same list.
 *
 * Why a contract exists at all: this plugin replaces `ctx.fs` and `ctx.sandbox`
 * with subclasses of the upstream providers, and `src/dialects.ts` recognizes
 * the kernel-sandbox profile by OBSERVING the argv shape `super.confine`
 * produced (ADR-0003). Both couplings are to pre-stable upstream internals that
 * carry no semver promise. An npm range like `>=0.1.2-alpha.4 <0.2.0` therefore
 * promises far more than the code was ever verified against; the allowlist
 * below promises exactly what CI has run.
 *
 * @module @dsh-electron/dsh-plugin-multi-root-workspace/compat/dsh-version

 * the upgrade smoke passed on that exact version — a green CI run on an
 * unlisted release is evidence, not authorization (ADR-0009).
