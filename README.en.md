# dsh-plugin-multi-root-workspace

[中文](./README.md) | English

## What & Why

An out-of-tree plugin bundle for DSH (DeepSeek Harness) that widens the Workspace write scope from a single canonical directory to "**one primary root + N additional roots**" — **without modifying any package in the upstream repository**.

The problem it solves: a real development project is usually several independent Git repositories, while DSH natively treats only the session working directory as the writable root, so working across repositories means juggling sessions.

Three things make this plugin worth looking at:

- **Zero learning cost for the agent**: it keeps using the native `read` / `write` / `edit` / `bash` tools. The plugin adds no `workspace_*` tools at all; it only widens the answer to the one question "which directories belong to this workspace".
- **Security does not degrade**: the additional roots are granted through the same mechanisms the harness already uses — the in-process fs fence plus kernel-level runners (Seatbelt on macOS, bwrap / Landlock on Linux) — with the fs side and bash/PTY sharing one and the same scope. It never degenerates into danger-full-access or prompt-level constraints.
- **Absent when absent**: it replaces the upstream `fs-sandbox` and `sandbox` provider rows through a bundle patch; with no additional root configured its behavior is item-for-item identical to an uninstalled harness, and every misconfiguration fails loudly instead of silently degrading.

**Done and released: the MVP `v0.1.0` (milestones M1–M3)** — composition and empty-root pass-through, multi-root capability and dialect grants, the root registry / the `/workspace-folders` command / the Workspace Folders panel / a cross-repository journey e2e.

**Done and released: the `v0.1.1` hardening batch (H1–H4)** — a cross-process Registry Authority Lease (when two DSH processes share one `$DSH_HOME`, only the lease holder grants additional roots; the other fails closed and takes over once the holder exits), panel primary-root authority derived from the host session (a client-named root is no longer accepted), DSH compatibility turned from a documented agreement into a **code contract enforced at startup** (an exact allowlist, mixed-install detection, a `src/compat/` adapter layer — see the "Upgrade Notes" in the [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.en.md)), and **an additional root's own `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` reaching the model** — native instruction discovery walks upward from the session cwd, so it can never reach an additional root.

**Done and released: `v0.1.2`** — with the `v0.1.1` contract unchanged, the supported upstream runtimes grow to `0.1.6-alpha.2` and `0.1.7-alpha.1` (the latter needs adapters for session format 4, in-process `PluginPackages`, bash `execute().result()`, and more); it also fixes the Workspace Folders panel on `0.1.6-alpha.2`, where dropping `current` from the Session catalog wrongly showed "No active session". See the [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.en.md).

**Done and released: `v0.1.3`** — with the `v0.1.2` contract unchanged, the supported upstream runtimes grow to `0.1.7-alpha.2` and `0.1.7-rc.1` (same shapes as `0.1.7-alpha.1`, no new adapter branch; from `rc.1`, install time enforces an exact `peerDependencies` match against the host runtime). See the [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.en.md).

**Done and released: `v0.1.4`** — with the `v0.1.3` contract unchanged, the supported upstream runtimes grow to `0.1.7-rc.2` (same shapes as `0.1.7-rc.1`, no new adapter branch; cordis stays at `~4.0.4`). See the [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.en.md).

**Done and released: `v0.1.5`** — with the `v0.1.4` contract unchanged, the supported upstream runtimes grow to `0.2.0-rc.2`, the first supported release of the 0.2 series (same shapes as `0.1.7-rc.2`, no new adapter branch; the sibling `0.2.0-rc.1` was never measured, so it is not on the list). See the [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.en.md).

The single source of truth for progress, numbering, and release state is the [roadmap progress ledger](./docs/plans/active/2026-09-12-multi-root-workspace.md#进度总账) (M1–M4 are the MVP milestone numbers, H1–H4 are the `v0.1.1` batch numbers, and H1 is M4); per-item evidence lives in the [completed plans](./docs/plans/README.md), and the user-visible changes of each version are in the [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.en.md).

## Quick Start

With a DSH runtime at hand (web / Electron desktop / headless all work), the shortest path is two commands — the plugin is published on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dsh-electron/dsh-plugin-multi-root-workspace):

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add @dsh-electron/dsh-plugin-multi-root-workspace
dsh --profile web
```

Once it is up, the **Folders** action (`🗂`) appears at the sidebar foot — or, straight in a session:

```text
/workspace-folders add ~/code/another-repo
```

The agent can now read, write, and run bash in that directory, with the same rights as this session's workspace. Other install sources (the GitHub repository / a local clone) and the command differences of running DSH from a source checkout are covered under [Installation](#installation).

## Requirements

- **Using the published plugin**: you need a *supported* DSH runtime — currently **`0.1.5-rc.2`, `0.1.6-alpha.1`, `0.1.6-alpha.2`, `0.1.7-alpha.1`, `0.1.7-alpha.2`, `0.1.7-rc.1`, `0.1.7-rc.2`, and `0.2.0-rc.2`**, and nothing else will install or run (see below; the sibling `0.2.0-rc.1` was never measured and is not on the list). `dsh plugin` installs the package into the matching profile, and no local Node toolchain is required
- **Building from source / contributing**: **Node.js** `^22.19.0 || >=24` (pinned by the repository's `engines`), **Git**, and **pnpm 11** (`packageManager` pins `pnpm@11.25.0`; corepack recommended)
- **DSH runtime**: the dev pin is exactly `0.1.5-rc.2`, the baseline among the supported releases; the upgrade procedure lives in the [development workflow](./docs/development/plugin-development-workflow.md)
- **Platforms**: kernel-level multi-root is complete on macOS (Seatbelt) and Linux (bwrap or Landlock); on Windows only the `fs` write path covers additional roots (confined bash/PTY does not — see [known limitations](#known-limitations))
- Running the smoke tests needs **no model credentials**: the e2e model turns are served by an inline scripted model endpoint

**The supported DSH versions are an exact list, not a range.** This plugin replaces `ctx.fs` and `ctx.sandbox` — the security boundary itself — and it recognizes kernel sandbox dialects from argv shapes measured against specific upstream releases. So `peerDependencies` names only the releases that have actually been through the full verification, and startup checks again: if the host's release is not on the list, or several `@deepseek-ai/dsh-*` packages disagree about which release they are, the fs / sandbox / registry / instructions rows **do not start**, the composition degrades to "this plugin is not installed", and one explanatory line is logged. To diagnose, see [troubleshooting: unsupported DSH release](./docs/troubleshooting/unsupported-dsh-release.md); for the reasoning, [ADR-0009](./docs/decisions/ADR-0009-dsh-compat-contract.md).

## Installation

`dsh plugin` supports four install sources. All commands below use the web profile as the example; for the Electron desktop swap `--profile web` for `--profile desktop` — the install method is the same.

| Source | Command | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| npm registry (recommended) | `dsh plugin --profile web add @dsh-electron/dsh-plugin-multi-root-workspace` | Pre-built artifacts, ready to use; the first `add` needs one `allowBuilds` answer (below) |
| tarball | `dsh plugin --profile web add ./dsh-electron-dsh-plugin-multi-root-workspace-<version>.tgz` | Pre-built offline package, handy for air-gapped or offline delivery — with the same one-time `allowBuilds` answer |
| local path | `dsh plugin --profile web add /path/to/package/dsh-plugin-multi-root-workspace` | pnpm `link:` to a local checkout; its dependencies are already installed in this repository — best for development |
| GitHub / git | `dsh plugin --profile web add github:cherrchen/dsh-plugin-multi-root-workspace` | Pulls source and builds it on the spot through `prepare`; needs **two** `allowBuilds` answers (this package plus `koffi`); pin a tag |

**Every install source needs one `allowBuilds` answer the first time.** The plugin carries a native dependency that must be built, `koffi` (the FFI wrapper behind Registry Authority on Windows; installed but unused elsewhere), and pnpm ≥10 runs no dependency lifecycle script by default. So the first `dsh plugin add` fails with `[ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS]` and leaves the pending decision in that profile's `pnpm-workspace.yaml`:

```yaml
allowBuilds:
  koffi: true          # the placeholder dsh leaves is "set this to true or false"
```

Set it to `true` and run `add` again. Read that line as **letting the dependency's install script run on your machine** (outside any sandbox the agent runs in) — `koffi`'s script only precompiles locally. Diagnosis steps: [Troubleshooting: the install stops at build approval](./docs/troubleshooting/install-stops-at-build-approval.md).

### Install from npm (recommended)

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add @dsh-electron/dsh-plugin-multi-root-workspace
```

This installs pre-built artifacts (the plugin itself is never compiled), but the first install still needs the `allowBuilds` answer above.

### Install from a tarball

```sh
pnpm pack @dsh-electron/dsh-plugin-multi-root-workspace
# or download the tgz from the GitHub Release assets, e.g.:
# https://github.com/cherrchen/dsh-plugin-multi-root-workspace/releases/download/v0.1.5/dsh-electron-dsh-plugin-multi-root-workspace-0.1.5.tgz
dsh plugin --profile web add ./dsh-electron-dsh-plugin-multi-root-workspace-0.1.5.tgz
```

Also pre-built (the plugin itself is never compiled here), handy for air-gapped or offline delivery — and the first `add` needs the same `allowBuilds` answer.

### Install from GitHub

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add github:cherrchen/dsh-plugin-multi-root-workspace
```

With pnpm ≥10 the first `add` fails: a git install pulls **source code rather than build artifacts**, so the package's self-contained `prepare` script must build it on the spot (a direct transpile of `src/`, no type-checking). Follow `dsh`'s guidance and copy the exact package keys pnpm prints into the profile's `pnpm-workspace.yaml` — this source has **two** pending decisions:

```yaml
allowBuilds:
  '@dsh-electron/dsh-plugin-multi-root-workspace': true
  koffi: true
```

Then run `add` again. Pinning a tag (e.g. `#v0.1.5`) is recommended so a later push cannot silently change what actually runs:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add github:cherrchen/dsh-plugin-multi-root-workspace#v0.1.5
```

### Install from a local clone (development & debugging)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/cherrchen/dsh-plugin-multi-root-workspace.git
cd dsh-plugin-multi-root-workspace
export CI=true    # without a TTY, pnpm's dependency self-check aborts; see the development workflow §8
pnpm install
pnpm build        # produces lib/ (not tracked by Git); the artifact test and installation both need it
dsh plugin --profile web add "$PWD"
```

> **Tip**: if your DSH comes from a source checkout (rather than `npm install -g @deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness`), the `dsh` binary is not on the global PATH — replace `dsh` with `pnpm dsh` in the commands above, e.g. `pnpm dsh plugin --profile web add ...` and `pnpm dsh --profile web`.

## Running

Development gates, with the result each step should produce:

```sh
pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck   # expect: 0 warnings, 0 errors; both tsconfigs pass
pnpm test                     # expect: all pass; dialect cases without a local kernel runner skip explicitly, with a reason
pnpm kernel:probe             # expect: reports the kernel runners this host has (seatbelt / bwrap / landlock)
pnpm smoke                    # expect: compose 40/40, behavior 99/99, journey 55/55
pnpm docs:check               # expect: 0 errors, 0 warnings
```

Install into a DSH runtime and verify the composition:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add "$PWD"
dsh --profile web --dump-config
```

Expected: **only** the `fs-sandbox` and `sandbox` rows are replaced by the plugin's `multi-root-fs` / `multi-root-sandbox`, with eight rows inserted (`multi-root-compat` / `fs` / `sandbox` / `scope` / `registry` / `instructions` / `command`, plus the client carrier row `multi-root-client`); `bash-sandbox` stays upstream (bash and the PTY backend take their roots from `ctx.sandbox`). After starting `dsh --profile web`, the Folders action appears at the sidebar foot.

## Usage

**The command** (the text entry point; also available headless):

```text
/workspace-folders                       # list the primary root and the additional roots
/workspace-folders add <absolute path>   # with no path, opens the OS directory chooser
/workspace-folders alias 1 payments      # name the first additional root
/workspace-folders remove 1              # by ordinal or by path
/workspace-folders reveal 1              # show it in the file manager
```

After an `add`, `list` prints:

```text
Workspace root (primary; access follows the current sandbox mode): /home/me/monorepo
  1 /home/me/payments-service [payments]
  2 /home/me/website
Writable additional roots: 2 of 2.
```

**The panel** (Web GUI): the **Folders** dialog at the sidebar foot lists the primary root and the additional roots, and offers add (through the composed directory picker or a typed path), remove, alias, copy path, reveal in the file manager, and move up/down. Its copy is bilingual and follows the interface language. A root's state is shown honestly: `missing` (absent right now) and `redirected` (replaced by a symlink pointing elsewhere) keep their registration but are **not granted**; once the directory is back, a `list` or a panel refresh grants it again — no restart.

**The model side**: the additional-root topology reaches the model through a `systemPrompt.context` snapshot attached to every request (same workspace, cwd unchanged) — no introspection tool needed. The full authorization semantics (canonicalization, `recordedPath` against symlink transplants, conflict rejection) live in the [architecture document](./docs/architecture/multi-root-workspace.md).

## Project Structure

```text
src/
  roots.ts        pure rules: canonicalization, conflict validation, record classification (available/missing/redirected/invalid)
  registry.ts     the root registry: dsh-storage-domain persistence, mutations of one primary root serialized in one queue
  registry-lease.ts / registry-lease-win32.ts
                  cross-process Registry Authority: POSIX flock and a Windows named semaphore (the kernel releases it on process death)
  scope.ts        ctx.multiRootScope: the single authorization source, plus the model-visible topology snapshot
  fs.ts           the multi-root filesystem provider (in-process fence, extends the upstream LocalFileSystem)
  sandbox.ts      the multi-root kernel-sandbox provider (extends the upstream LocalSandboxProvider)
  dialects.ts     Seatbelt / bwrap / Landlock profile recognition and additional-grant assembly (unrecognized shapes fail loudly)
  containment.ts  path containment (lexical fast path plus a dev/ino alias fallback)
  instructions.ts discovery, incremental delivery, budget and revocation for an additional root's AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md (top level plus the subdirectories this session touched, injected from agent/pre-step)
  compat.ts       the multi-root-compat startup gate (version allowlist and mixed-install detection)
  compat/         the version-difference adapters: dsh-version / sandbox-confine / agent-instructions / llm-message (optional peers loaded on demand)
  command.ts      the /workspace-folders command and the host half of the panel RPC
  contract.ts     the panel wire protocol (zod-validated on both ends, inlinable into the browser bundle)
  client/         the browser half: sidebar action, dialog, bilingual dictionaries
tests/            differential parity, real-execution dialect matrix, contract round-trips, component and locale gates, cross-process lease e2e, instruction injection
scripts/          smoke batteries (compose / behavior / journey) plus the docs, kernel-runner, compatibility-contract and upgrade checks
docs/             requirements, architecture, decision records (ADRs), plans, development workflow
```

## Contributing

Issues and PRs are welcome:

1. Read [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) (repository-wide rules) and the [development workflow](./docs/development/plugin-development-workflow.md) (environment, commands, the runtime support matrix, the upgrade procedure) first.
2. Branch from `main`; follow conventional commits (`feat` / `fix` / `perf` / `refactor` + scope) — see the existing history.
3. All of these must pass locally before a PR: `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm build`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm docs:check`, `pnpm smoke` (CI runs the same order, build before test).
4. Behavior changes update the matching document under `docs/` in the same change; keep the README bilingual pair in sync; record engineering decisions that involve trade-offs as ADRs.
5. Hard constraint: **never modify any package of the upstream repository (deepseek-harness)**; the plugin stays an out-of-tree extension.

## Known Limitations

- An additional root's instruction files arrive as they become relevant: the one at the root's top level is injected before the session's first step, and a subdirectory's is injected once the session has **successfully** worked in that directory. A nested file is re-examined only when its directory is examined (the root's own every step; a subdirectory's because it was delivered from, or because of a fresh touch), delivery state is in-process (so a resumed session may be told again), and only the `read` / `write` / `edit` tool names count. The primary root's chain and the user-global file remain upstream's job, and this plugin does not inject them a second time ([ADR-0010](./docs/decisions/ADR-0010-additional-root-instruction-scope.md)).
- Single writer per store: only one DSH process at a time may hold the root registry for a given `$DSH_HOME`; another process reports the registry as unavailable (`registry-contended`) and takes over on refresh once the holder exits or crashes. That is deliberate fail-closed behavior, not a race waiting to be fixed ([ADR-0007](./docs/decisions/ADR-0007-registry-authority-lease.md)).
- The supported matrix is an exact-version allowlist: on a host whose release is not on the list, or whose core packages disagree about the release, the `fs` / `sandbox` / `registry` / `instructions` rows **do not start** and the composition degrades to "the plugin is not installed" ([ADR-0009](./docs/decisions/ADR-0009-dsh-compat-contract.md)).
- Kernel-level multi-root does not exist on Windows: the `fs` write path covers additional roots, but confined bash/PTY cannot write them (the plugin emits one explicit warning for a populated scope); see the first-release scope in the [requirements document](./docs/requirements/multi-root-workspace.md).
- An additional root has the same rights as the primary root (no per-root read-only), and cannot become the default working directory of bash/PTY (session cwd semantics are unchanged).
- The `workspace-files` client file tree still sees the primary root only.
- The command's own output text is English (a host-side handler has no active locale to consult); the panel is bilingual.
- The Workspace Folders panel is a sidebar footer action plus a dialog rather than a full panel: `sidebar.footer.action` is offered by every supported release, whereas `sidebar.panellist` / `main` are not.
