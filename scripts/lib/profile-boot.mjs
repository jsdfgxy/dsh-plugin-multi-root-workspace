/**
 * Compose a scratch profile's effective entry list and boot it in-process.
 *
 * This mirrors what the CLI does before it mounts a profile: load the
 * profile's bundle layers, make the bundles' bare specifiers resolve, then
 * hand the composed patch stack to `app-boot`'s `boot()`. How resolution is
 * installed changed shape, and this file probes that by export name:
 *
 * ```text
 * 0.1.5-rc.2 / 0.1.6   healProfilesModuleFallback({ installAnchor, profile })
 * 0.1.7-alpha.1 through 0.1.7-rc.2, and 0.2.0-rc.2   createRuntimeResolution(...) then PluginPackages
 * ```
 *
 * `0.1.7-alpha.1` computes the resolution and installs it as a host service
 * inside `boot`'s prepare callback; it no longer writes a module-fallback
 * directory. Booting in-process is what makes the behavior smoke
 * credential-free — no model call is involved.
 *
 * @module scripts/lib/profile-boot
